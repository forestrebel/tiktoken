# RAILS: Theory and Practice

## Theory: The Vision

### Core Philosophy
- Every tool reduces chaos
- Build on existing patterns
- Optimize for developer flow
- Quality through automation
- Speed through reliability

### Key Principles
1. **Reliable**: Every step verifiable
2. **Automated**: Minimal manual intervention
3. **Integrated**: All parts connected
4. **Logged**: Clear status at all times
5. **Systematic**: Follow patterns

## Practice: The Implementation

### 1. Command Infrastructure
```bash
# Core command structure
t verify pipeline  # Version + dependency check
t verify all      # All services health
t verify flow     # Critical path testing
t deploy core     # Core API deployment
t deploy front    # Frontend deployment
```

### 2. Verification Chain
- **Python Alignment**
  - .python-version: 3.12.4
  - Pipfile configuration
  - CI environment

- **Service Health**
  - Mobile App: React Native build status
  - Firebase Auth: Authentication service
  - Cloud Storage: Nature video storage
  - Firestore: Creator and token data
  - Cloud Functions: Video processing and rewards
  - Video Processing: Quality and nature validation
  - Token Distribution: Creator reward system

- **Integration Points**
  - Mobile App → Video Upload (720x1280, BT.709)
  - Cloud Functions → Video Processing
  - Cloud Functions → Nature Content Validation
  - Cloud Functions → Token Distribution
  - System → Creator Notifications

### 3. Deployment Pipeline
- **Mobile App (React Native)**
  - Platform-specific builds (iOS/Android)
  - Native module verification
  - Performance monitoring

- **Firebase Services**
  - Authentication configuration
  - Storage bucket setup
  - Firestore rules deployment
  - Cloud Functions deployment
  - Security rules verification

- **Google Cloud Platform**
  - Service account management
  - API quota monitoring
  - Resource allocation

### 4. Quality Gates
- **Video Upload**
  - Resolution check (720x1280)
  - Color space validation (BT.709)
  - FPS verification (29.97-30)
  - Size limit (6MB)
  - Duration check (60s)
  - Nature content validation

- **During Processing**
  - Upload state tracking
  - Processing progress
  - Quality validation
  - Nature content score
  - Token calculation

- **Post-Processing**
  - Creator notification
  - Token distribution
  - View tracking setup
  - Engagement metrics
  - Quality scoring

### 5. Developer Tools
```python
# Key verification patterns
async def verify_python_versions():
    """Verify Python version alignment."""
    pass

async def verify_deployment_readiness():
    """Pre-flight deployment checks."""
    pass

async def verify_service_health():
    """Service health verification."""
    pass
```

### 6. Lessons Learned

2. Performance monitoring
3. Advanced rollback
4. Scaling patterns

## Success Metrics

### 1. Speed
- Local verification < 30 seconds
- Deployment < 5 minutes
- Rollback < 2 minutes

### 2. Reliability
- All services monitored
- Clear health status
- Fast error detection

### 3. Quality
- No deployment without verification
- All integrations tested
- Clear status reporting

## Daily Usage

### 1. Development Flow
```bash
# Start of day
t verify all          # Check system health
t verify pipeline     # Verify environment

# During development
t verify flow         # Test critical paths
t deploy --verify     # Deploy with checks

# End of day
t verify all          # Ensure clean state
```

### 2. Deployment Flow
```bash
# Pre-deployment
t verify pipeline     # Check readiness
t verify keys         # Verify credentials

# Deployment
t deploy mobile      # Deploy mobile app
t deploy firebase    # Deploy Firebase config

# Post-deployment
t verify live         # Check deployment
t verify flow         # Test integration
```

## Remember
1. Always verify first
2. Keep notifications flowing
3. Test before deploy
4. Document as you go
5. Maintain patterns
