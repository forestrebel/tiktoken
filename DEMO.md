# TikToken Demo Script

A step-by-step guide for demonstrating the video processing system.

## Setup

1. Start all services:
```bash
# Terminal 1: Backend
cd backend
pipenv shell
uvicorn main:app --reload

# Terminal 2: Monitor logs
docker-compose logs -f
```

2. Prepare test videos:
- `valid.mp4`: 720x1280, 30fps
- `invalid.mp4`: 1920x1080, 30fps

## Demo Flow

### 1. System Health (30s)

Show system readiness:
```bash
# Check system health
curl http://localhost:5000/health | jq

# Expected output:
{
  "status": "ok",
  "dependencies": {
    "ffmpeg": {"status": "ok"},
    "magic": {"status": "ok"}
  },
  "storage": {"status": "ok"}
}
```

### 2. Happy Path (2min)

Demonstrate successful video processing:

1. Upload valid video:
```bash
curl -F "file=@valid.mp4" http://localhost:5000/upload
```

2. Show real-time status:
```bash
# Get video ID from upload response
export VIDEO_ID="..."

# Check status
curl http://localhost:5000/videos/$VIDEO_ID/status

# Expected progression:
# - pending
# - processing
# - completed
```

3. View metadata:
```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/videos/$VIDEO_ID/metadata
```

### 3. Error Handling (2min)

Show error recovery:

1. Try invalid video:
```bash
curl -F "file=@invalid.mp4" http://localhost:5000/upload

# Expected error:
{
  "error": "Invalid resolution: 1920x1080",
  "suggestions": [
    "Video must be exactly 720x1280",
    "Use a video editor to resize",
    "Most phones can record in this resolution natively"
  ]
}
```

2. Show system remains stable:
```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/health
```

3. Successfully upload valid video after error

### 4. Performance (2min)

Demonstrate system performance:

1. Concurrent uploads:
```bash
# Upload 3 videos simultaneously
for i in {1..3}; do
  curl -F "file=@valid.mp4" http://localhost:5000/upload &
done
```

2. Show status polling:
```bash
# Poll status for all videos
for id in $VIDEO_IDS; do
  curl http://localhost:5000/videos/$id/status
done
```

3. Monitor system health during load:
```bash
watch -n 1 'curl -s http://localhost:5000/health'
```

### 5. Technical Highlights (1min)

Key points to emphasize:
- Fast processing (< 3s uploads)
- Clear error messages
- Real-time status updates
- System stability under load
- Comprehensive monitoring

## Common Questions

### Q: What happens if the video is too large?
A: System provides clear error with size limits and suggestions for compression.

### Q: Can it handle multiple concurrent uploads?
A: Yes, tested with 10+ concurrent uploads while maintaining performance.

### Q: What about network issues?
A: System provides clear error messages and recovery paths for network failures.

### Q: How do you monitor system health?
A: Real-time monitoring via health endpoint with component-level status.

## Troubleshooting

If issues occur during demo:

1. Check system health:
```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/health
```

2. Verify services:
```bash
docker-compose ps
```

3. Reset if needed:
```bash
docker-compose restart
```

## Next Steps

Potential enhancements to discuss:
- Cloud storage integration
- Authentication system
- Multiple processing nodes
- Advanced error recovery
